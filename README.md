## **WordFinder** - Find words for Scrabble, Jumble or even Hangman.

A clean interface to find the word that you want rapidly based upon any number of contextual clues. I wrote this to be used as an offline app, that doesn't have any ads or paywalls and runs quickly even on older hardware.

**To use for Scrabble or Jumble**: simply type all the letters you have, and in scrabble you can use "contains" to find words that connect to other letters you have on the board.

**To use for Hangman**: use only the "Contains" field and use Underscores '_' to fill in for unknown letters, and length to give words with only that length.
